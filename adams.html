            <i>"'I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me,' intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. 'A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate - and yet I will design it for you.

And it shall be called ... <strong>The Earth</strong>"</i>
